# Lost&Found
A Laravel based site to help people find their lost items :)

**NOTE: This is still a work in progress!**

Up-to-date preview: https://lostandfound.idevele.com

Basically, Lost&Found will be a service which will help people who lost (or something was stolen from them) or found something in a given area. It is not limited to a certain location, so it can be easily used internationally.

At the moment, I'm mainly working on the backend, and the frontend is a raw afterthought. It will be refactored and polished once I finish most of the work in the backend.

**What's working for now?**

- Geolocating and Google Maps integration
- Adding an item
- Uploading images
- Notification emails in case someone finds or losts an item in a certain distance from a location

**What's still left to do till a beta release?**
- Moderation. As for now, it will only feature a minimal moderation method, but a more advanced administration is planned. 
- Editing and deleting an item
- Some commands, f.e. for deleting expired stuff
- Frontend design
- Tests
